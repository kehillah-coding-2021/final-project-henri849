Blender racing game + mediapipe + other models to make it actually controllable

WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO:
The objective of the project is to effectively make a 3d blender car game hopefully with gravity and collision (if I ever get past the 11 wait time the blender forum has) the
use a companion of mediapipe's hand model, TensorFlow models off the dataset I made (to control acceleration and to know if you're trying to steer)

UPDATE:
I might consider using UPBGE bc blender depricated their game engine in 2015


Sadly the windows screen record can only caputure one window at a time and opencv creates a new one where it shows the webcam

SETING UP BLENDER
this aplies only if I can't export the file in an usable way
1. install blender 2.79 32 (even if on 64 bit) bit from the blender website link will be added
2. follow the last comment on https://blenderartists.org/t/how-to-add-external-python-modules-to-the-bge-so-they-work-in-the-exported-run-time/566542/12
3. open blender after the modifications naviage to file -> open select the blender file that I will rovide
4. next to the words Default (top center) click on the weird box (images will be provided) swich to 3D Full View and press P USE ESC to kill program bc of how blender works the mouse will disapear when over blender windows when program is being ran
LIABILITY
1. I cannot garenty the safety of the program and running and modifiing the script is at your OWN RISK
2. this was made for windows 10 and might not work without all the apropreate libraries
3. It uses the camera so risks come with that
4. As always these are warnings and potentital outcomes, I have never seen it damage anything but I don't want to be responsible




### Grading
This project will use the usual rubric we have used this year. Make sure to add docstrings to all your functions and edit this README. Make sure to put any dependencies in a 'requirements.txt' file. Commit and push your work often. Most importantly, have fun
