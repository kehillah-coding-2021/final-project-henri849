Blender racing game + mediapipe + other models to make it actually controllable

WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO:
The objective of the project is to effectively make a 3d blender car game hopefully with gravity and collision (if I ever get past the 11 wait time the blender forum has) the
use a companion of mediapipe's hand model, TensorFlow models off the dataset I made (to control acceleration and to know if you're trying to steer)

NOTE:
HERE IS THE BLENDER VERSION TO USE, IT HAS THE INSTALLED LIBS AND THE MODEL (ONLY INSTALL IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE GAME INSIDE BLENDER AND THE LOGIC BRICKS AND EDIT STUFF:

Car logic (the skip count should be set according to the computor and what it can handle fiddle with it if the game is too fast or slow/jerky ) 8-2 is recommend

Demo, it may apear laggy or slow, it is parcialy cause by the fact that I was using zoom as a screen recorder and it is neither slow or efficiant in terms of processing power it uses

ZIP (the sip and game might seems massive but blender packs a version of blender in it so it's running the game ontop of blender):

EXPERIMENTAL, has a sky sphere, better textures, better/actual map but still has problems with colisions (the map icnludes more complex notably concave polygons that mess with the engine) I also sadly didn't have time to shoot a good video (it works in most lighting conditions but less well (better in very sunny then little light))

RUNNING THE DEMO: (ADD NEWSEST EXECUTABLES):
Install the wanted version, link uptop, extract them/unzip them, then double click on the exe name test.blend.exe (i'm not sure why it's sammed that) it should take 30s-2 minutes to load, it will most likely go unresponsive (NORAML don't stop it) and then the game should pop up, clicking on the winow's X should stop it and stop it's execution as well as the escape key.
PLAYING THE GAME:
Here are some of the new features:

LIABILITY
1. I cannot garenty the safety of the program and running and modifiing the script is at your OWN RISK
2. this was made for windows 10 and might not work without all the apropreate libraries
3. It uses the camera so risks come with that
4. As always these are warnings and potentital outcomes, I have never seen it damage anything but I don't want to be responsible
