Blender racing game + mediapipe + other models to make it actually controllable 

WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO:
The objective of the project is to effectively make a 3d blender car game hopefully with gravety and colision (if I ever get past the 11 wait perion the blender forum has) the
use a compitanion of media-pipe's hand model, tensorflow models off the a dataset I made (to controle acseleration and to know if your trying to steer)
