Blender racing game + mediapipe + other models to make it actually controllable

WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO:
The objective of the project is to effectively make a 3d blender car game hopefully with gravity and collision (if I ever get past the 11 wait time the blender forum has) the
use a companion of mediapipe's hand model, TensorFlow models off the dataset I made (to control acceleration and to know if you're trying to steer)

### Grading
This project will use the usual rubric we have used this year. Make sure to add docstrings to all your functions and edit this README. Make sure to put any dependencies in a 'requirements.txt' file. Commit and push your work often. Most importantly, have fun!
