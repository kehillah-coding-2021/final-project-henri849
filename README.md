# final-project

The final project is an opportunity to apply what you have learned and take on new challenges. Your final project can be anything you want, but using classes in some way is strongly encouraged. The following are some ideas to help you choose a project. Your project does not have to come from this list.

### Games
Implement a game, such as tic-tac-toe or connect-4. For games like this, you can create a `Board` class that has methods such as `place_marker`, `check_win`, and `display`. You can use a list of lists or a dictionary of lists as an instance variable to represent the board. Create a while loop in which players take turns placing markers.

Create a game using cards or dice, implementing the classes from chapter 10.

Use a package/framework like [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) or [kivy](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/intro.html) to create a game, app, or simulation. Look for pong tutorials.

Create a text adventure game. In the game you do things like battle, collect resources, solve puzzles, etc.

### Textbook Chapters
You may fulfill the requirements of the final project by exploring one of the textbook chapters we skipped. These chapters are slightly more advanced. Chapter 6 deals with image processing, chapter 7 is data mining and statistical methods, chapter 8 is about encryption, and chapter 9 explores fractals and [recursion](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_recursion.asp#:~:text=Python%20also%20accepts%20function%20recursion,that%20a%20function%20calls%20itself.&text=The%20recursion%20ends%20when%20the,i.e.%20when%20it%20is%200).

### Old projects
If you liked the user-management or the json-api project, you may return to one of these projects and revamp, add more advanced features, etc. There is a [json-api for the marvel universe](https://developer.marvel.com/docs). There is a [python api for reddit](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that you can use to analyze data or create a bot. Try creating a [discord bot](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/) with python. If you liked user management and want to try building an actual website, explore [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/). This will require a little HTML. You can use [this project](https://github.com/kelleydv/bapa) as an example.

### Grading
This project will use the usual rubric we have used this year. Make sure to add docstrings to all your functions and edit this README. Make sure to put any dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file. Commit and push your work often. Most importantly, have fun!
