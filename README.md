Blender racing game + mediapipe + other models to make it actually controllable

WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO:
The objective of the project is to effectively make a 3d blender car game hopefully with gravity and collision (if I ever get past the 11 wait time the blender forum has) the
use a companion of mediapipe's hand model, TensorFlow models off the dataset I made (to control acceleration and to know if you're trying to steer)

NOTE:
HERE IS THE BLENDER VERSION TO USE, IT HAS THE INSTALLED LIBS AND THE MODEL:

Demon, it may apear laggy or slow, it is parcialy cause by the fact that I was using zoom as a screen recorder and it is neither slow or efficiant in terms of processing power it uses

LIABILITY
1. I cannot garenty the safety of the program and running and modifiing the script is at your OWN RISK
2. this was made for windows 10 and might not work without all the apropreate libraries
3. It uses the camera so risks come with that
4. As always these are warnings and potentital outcomes, I have never seen it damage anything but I don't want to be responsible




### Grading
This project will use the usual rubric we have used this year. Make sure to add docstrings to all your functions and edit this README. Make sure to put any dependencies in a 'requirements.txt' file. Commit and push your work often. Most importantly, have fun
